# animation-studio

AnimationStudio is a basic pixel art editor that allows users to combine 'frames' of pixel art to create animations.

## Design
The user will be able to piece together individual frames, select a frame to edit, and preview an animation from within the studio.

Changes to frames will take place in the frame editor, where users can select from a palette of color options to change pixels.
